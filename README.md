# Recipe Generator - Project PRA2031
> This project is a recipe generator built in Python using object oriented programming (OOP) principles. The program allows users to input their available ingredients and specify dietary restrictions. Based on these inputs, the application generates a selection of suitable dishes, displays their respective healthiness scores in a graph format, and enables the user to choose a preferred dish. Once selected, the full recipe is presented to the user.

## Purpose
We built the Recipe Generator with the aim to simplify everyday cooking by helping users turn available ingredients into suitable and healthy recipes, regardless of their dietary needs or cooking experience. We undertook this project specifically because, as students, we often struggle to decide what to cook with limited ingredients and thought it would be a very useful program to have.

## Features
<ins>Classes</ins>
- Ingredients
- Dietary restriction
- Healthiness score
- Recipe
  
> To keep the project organized, each class was created in its own file. These classes are then imported and used together in a main file, which controls the overall program flow.
